# tictactoe

Tic Tac Toe game in C. Built-in bot too!

Currently, the game can be made any size larger than 2x2 (though they will always be square).

Still to come:
-

Run-time changeable game size, number of players, high score table (number of wins).

Ability to also edit credentials of players (name for high-score table, tile to use in game).
